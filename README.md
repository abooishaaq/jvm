# jvm

```
I was bored and with exams close,
Yet a spark within me arose.
A curious mind, eager to explore,
To build a JVM, something to adore.

Abandoning the textbooks and study guides,
I delved into the code, no place to hide.
Lines of Java, bytecodes, and more,
An endeavor to embark upon, I swore.
```

## What is this?

I thought I could write a jvm simple enough to execute a hello world in a few hours but couldn'd do it.
It just parses `.class` files. I might continue working on it in the future or abandon it altogether.
